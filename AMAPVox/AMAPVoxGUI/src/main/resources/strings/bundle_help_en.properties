help_NaNs_correction=The \u00ab\u00a0Correct NaN's\u00a0\u00bb checkbox can be selected in order to fill all not informed voxels (transmittance and PAD equals to NaN, meaning the value could not be determined).\n\
This happens when voxel sampling is insufficient or null.\n\
See documentation for information about the algorithm.\n\
The threshold is the minimum mean sampling for the voxel neighborhood for which the voxel is considered valid.
help_bbox=Automatic calculation of the extremums given a set of points (ALS only).\n\
Fast option choice read the extremums in header file (als, laz).\n\
In case where an additional transformation is set (VOP matrix), the option behaviour will be the same as the \u00ab\u00a0Deep search\u00bb option.\n\
\u00ab\u00a0Deep search\u00a0\u00bb option choice read all points from the file, apply a VOP matrix if there is any and does filtering by classification as defined in the tab \u00ab\u00a0Filter\u00a0\u00bb \u2192 \u00ab\u00a0Other\u00a0\u00bb.
help_hemiphoto=The tab "From hemi scans" mean that the hemispherical photography is generated from the lidar scans.\n\
The scans should be at the same position.\n\
The most important is to have an hemispherical cover.\n\n\
The tab "From PAD" allows you to generate an hemispherical photography from a voxel file, using the PAD values.
help_empty_shots_filter= Artificial empty shots may be provided by Riegl TLS scanners for objects too close to the sensor (around 1m).\n\
This option allows to remove those "false" empty shots.
help_3D_viewer=The mode 1 allows you to visualize a voxel space file selected in the bottom right list.\n\
You can also display a raster in ascii grid format (*.asc) at the same time as the voxel file.\n\n\
The mode 2 is a new more flexible 3d item viewer. You can display in it as many element as you want.\n\
The supported formats right now are : \n\
\t-Rasters :\n\
\t\t-Ascii grid format (*.asc)\n\n\
\t-Point clouds:\n\
\t\t-rxp, rsp\n\
\t\t-las, laz\n\
\t\t-ptx, ptg\n\
\t\t-csv file (values separated by columns)\n\n\
\t-Voxel file: it is inadisable, use mode 1 for this purpose\n\n
